</center><h2><u>How to make Pizza Recipe</u></h2><p></p></center>
I have divided my step-by-step guide into 3 main sections for you to be able to make 
this best Veggie Pizza easily. 
<p> 1. Make pizza dough <p></p>
    2. Make pizza sauce <p></p>
    3. Assemble & bake
    <p>  <center><h2><i> 1. Make Pizza Dough</i></h2></center>
<p></p>1. This recipe will make enough dough for 4 small or 3 medium sized or 2 large pizzas. 
       It’s great for preparing ahead of time keeping in the fridge overnight.
       you’re ready to use! 
       <p> 2. Add 1 cup of lukewarm water (44 degrees Celsius) and stir. Set aside and let the yeast activate.</p>
    <p> 3. Gradually add 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Mix well until the dough starts to come together.</p>
    <p> 4. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>
    <p> 5. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</p>

     <center><h2><i> 2. Make Pizza Sauce</i></h2></center>
        <p>1. You can choose to either chop the tomatoes (500 grams or 5 to 6 medium tomatoes) and use them fresh to make the sauce,
            or blanch them first and then add in a blender. <p>
        <center><img src="piz2.png"width="150"></center>
        <p> 2.Blanching will reduce the cooking time, but is not necessary for making a delicious sauce.</p>
        <p> 3. Next, in a large sauce pan heat ¼ cup olive oil, and add 2 teaspoons minced 
            garlic.Sauté and stir for some seconds to soften the garlic.</p>
          <center><img src="piz4.png"width="150"></center>
    <p>4. Now add the tomato puree, and mix well.Continue stirring and let the tomatoes cook for 5 minutes.
        Add salt as needed. Mix and stir.</p>
        <p>5. Cover the pan with lid and simmer the tomato sauce on low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally,
            until the tomatoes have softened.</p>
        <p>6. Once the sauce is ready, remove it from heat and let it cool. You can store it in an airtight container
            in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

            <center><h2><i> 3.Assemble & Bake Pizza</i></h2></center>
            <p>1.First, preheat the oven to the highest temperature in your oven. In my oven it is 230 degrees Celsius (450 degrees Fahrenheit).
            Use both the top and bottom heating elements of the oven as we want a uniform and even baking of the pizza.
            Grease a round metal baking pan with olive oil, and then lightly dust it with maize flour (cornmeal),semolina (rava or sooji) or flour.</p>
            <center><img src="piz0.png"width="150">>
        <p>2. Divide the homemade pizza dough into equals parts to make either 4 small or 2 large or 3 medium size pizzas.
          Wrap any dough you’re not using in plastic wrap and keep in the fridge for up to 3 days total.</p>
          <center><img src="piz6.png"width="150"></center>
          <p> 3. Using clean, dry hands, take one portion of the divided dough and roll it into a neat round ball.
           Place on a cutting board or countertop that’s been lightly coated with some flour, and sprinkle the dough with a light dusting of more flour</p>
           <p> 4.  Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a large round or oval shape of about ⅛ to ¼ inch thickness.
            Roll the dough from the center towards the outer edges for the most even pizza dough. You may have to dust the surface with flour as you work.
            A pizza dough is always stretched with hands and not rolled. Stretching the dough with your hands needs practice.
          For most home cooks, rolling the dough is much easier and so I have included this step. You could also flatten and press the dough with your fingers directly in the baking pan.
          I do stretch or flatten the dough with my hands but not everyone is good at this. Thus rolling makes it easier.</p>
          <p> 5. Once stretched to the desired size, gently place the pizza base in the greased baking pan. 
            Be careful not to tear the dough, as it is very soft and stretchy.</p>

            <p>6. At this point you can prick the dough with a fork if you want a thinner, crisper crust. 
                This also helps in the crust not puffing up when baking</p>

            <p>7. Then, spread the tomato sauce on the pizza in a thin, even layer. Leave about an inch of dough around the outer edge free from sauce for a perfect pizza crust.</p>
           <p> 8.Top the sauce with a generous handful or two of shredded mozzarella cheese</p>

            <p>9. Place your choice of veggies on top of the cheese, making sure to spread the toppings evenly.</p>
            <p>10.In the below photo, the vegetable toppings are red onion, green & red bell pepper and steamed corn kernels.</p>
